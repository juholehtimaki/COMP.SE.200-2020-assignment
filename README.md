# Software testing assignment

Juho Lehtim√§ki and Hannes Aaltonen

Found bugs/faults:

- filter.js

  - if no elements in the array match the predicate, the function will return an array containing an empty array `[[ ]]` (should be just an empty array), this also happens when filtering an empty array
  - can cause a lot of problems as the items are usually filtered using some kind of predicate (e.g. price < 10)
  - severity critical

- castArray.js

  - if no parameters were given, should return an empty array
  - severity low

- compact.js

  - does not remove falsy values correctly
  - severity major

- defaultTo.js

  - does not give the default value when given NaN as value
  - severity major

- divide.js

  - not calculate the division correctly
    - divides the divisor with divisor (e.g when called with (10, 5), 10 will be divided with 10)
  - severity critical

- eq.js

  - does not compare the types correctly (e.g. when given "test" and Object("test) returns true)
  - severity critical
